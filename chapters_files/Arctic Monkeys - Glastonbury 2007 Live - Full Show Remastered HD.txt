00:08  when the sun goes down
03:40  brianstorm
06:49  still take you home
10:13  dancing shoes
12:42  from the ritz to the rubble
16:22  teddy picker
19:22  this house is a circus
22:55  fake tales of san francisco
25:39  balaclava
28:34  i bet you look good on the dancefloor
31:13  old yellow bricks
34:29  temptation greets you like your naughty friend ft. dizzee rascal
38:15  if you were there, beware
43:15  fluorescent adolescent
46:36  mardy bum
49:49  do me a favour
53:13  leave before the lights come on
57:24  the view from the afternoon
1:00:53  diamonds are forever
1:04:30  505
1:09:46  a certain romance
